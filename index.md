Hello! My name is Tito Spadini and I was born in 1989 at SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil.

I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Information Engineering at _Signals & Systems Lab_ from Universidade Federal do ABC.

Meanwhile, I work on several side projects which I choose to do because I believe that all scientists, on principle, should use their own knowledge to contribute to society, preferably by communicating with people outside the academic environment. These side projects are: a Podcast, a Medium blog, YouTube channel, multiple Facebooks pages, and some keynotes that I organize from time to time; all about **STEM** (**S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering & **M**athematics) and Education.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
